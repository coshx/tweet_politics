complications:
-political posts are either mostly about political philosophy (libertarianism, communism, anarchy, lots of Marxist theory like Deleuze) or current events; only the philosophy is consistent, because current event posts have transient keywords
    -classifying political current event tweets will be less accurate over time
    -need to expand corpus
        -try political twitter feeds?
